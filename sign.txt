                     WLAN JUMPER 
============================================================

Thank you for using WLAN Jumper! 
This tool ensures you always have the best possible 
connection by jumping between your networks automatically. 

This is my first project. I'm still learning, so please go 
easy on me! I can guarantee that the code is completely safe.
The interface and logs are kept in English for international 
compatibility.

QUICK GUIDE:
------------------------------------------------------------
* HOW TO START: Always run the "Start_WLAN_Jumper.bat". 
  It will handle Admin rights and the PowerShell setup.

* SETUP: On startup, you can choose how many failed pings 
  (1-12) are allowed before the "Jump" happens.

* MONITORING: The program pings 8.8.8.8 every second. 
  - Green dots (.) mean your connection is stable.
  - Yellow/Red warnings show latency or connection drops.

* AUTO-SWITCH: If your ping hits >1200ms or drops for your 
  chosen amount of times, it automatically jumps to the 
  strongest authorized WiFi in range.

* LOGS: Every session creates a detailed log file in the 
  "WLANjumper > Logs" folder so you can track every jump.
